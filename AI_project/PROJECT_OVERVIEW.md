- **Ollama (Open Source)** - Integrated this open-source LLM runtime for local model hosting and inference
- **Custom API Layer** - Built on top of open-source foundations with multiple connection strategies and fallback mechanisms

### AI Models Integrated
- **DeepSeek Coder 1.3b**: Ultra-fast, lightweight model (776MB) specialized for coding
- **Mistral Latest**: Powerful general-purpose model (4.4GB) for complex reasoning
- **Llama 3.2**: Balanced performance model (2GB) for versatile tasks

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript** for static typing and enhanced developer experience
- **ESLint** for code quality and consistency
- **Custom Build Pipeline** with code splitting and chunk optimization

---

## üß† AI Logic & Prompt Engineering

### Advanced System Prompting
I developed a sophisticated system prompt that:
- **Enforces coding best practices** (clean syntax, no type annotations)
- **Provides structured responses** with step-by-step explanations
- **Handles non-coding queries gracefully** with helpful redirection
- **Optimizes for educational value** rather than just providing answers

### Intelligent Content Filtering
```typescript
// Smart programming detection
const isProgrammingRelated = (input: string): boolean => {
  const programmingKeywords = [
    'function', 'class', 'variable', 'loop', 'array', 'object',
    'algorithm', 'data structure', 'debugging', 'syntax error',
    // ... extensive keyword matching
  ]
  // Advanced pattern matching for code snippets and technical queries
}
```

### Context-Aware Model Selection
- **Dynamic model switching** based on query complexity
- **Optimized token limits** (2048 for fast models, 4096 for complex tasks)
- **Intelligent timeout handling** with progressive fallbacks

---

## üîß Technical Innovations

### Multi-Layer Connection Strategy
I implemented a sophisticated connection hierarchy:

1. **Direct Ollama Connection**: Fastest path, bypasses all authentication
2. **CORS-Enabled Proxy**: Browser-safe connection with proper headers
3. **Vite Dev Server Proxy**: Development-time fallback for seamless testing
4. **Open WebUI Gateway**: Full-featured backend with authentication

### Error Handling & Resilience
```typescript
// Advanced error recovery system
try {
  return await sendDirectOllamaMessage(messages, selectedModel)
} catch (directError) {
  console.error('Direct connection failed, trying backend proxy...')
  try {
    return await backendProxy(messages, selectedModel)
  } catch (proxyError) {
    // Graceful degradation to development mode
    return fallbackToMockResponse(messages)
  }
}
```

### Authentication & Security
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token storage and validation
- **API Key Integration**: Compatible with Open WebUI authentication
- **Development Mode**: Safe testing environment with mock responses
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
